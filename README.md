<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We created a food app with my study team by using an API from [https://spoonacular.com/food-api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) <br /> <br />
Search Bar coded by [Kamil Degerliyurt](https://github.com/kamildegerliyurt)   <br />
Middle Area coded by [Ibrahim Tuzer](https://github.com/IbrahimTuzer)  <br />
Bottom Area coded by me, [Hakan Ozdemir](https://github.com/devhakanozdemir).

Our mentor is [Muhammet ARSLANTAS](https://github.com/Muhammed58) <br /><br /><br />

PS: You can't see images of foods because of API's free subscription poilicy.
